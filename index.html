        <h2>Importance of Mental Health 🌿</h2>
        <p>
          In today’s fast-paced world, mental health is as important as physical
          health. Everyday stress from studies, work, or social life can lead to
          anxiety and burnout. Taking care of your mind helps you stay calm,
          creative, and truly happy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regular relaxation, mindfulness, and expressing emotions can reduce
          stress and improve productivity.

          <h1>THE RESAERCH PAPER SUMMARY</h1>
          <p>
            1. A Comprehensive Analysis of Trapezius Muscle EMG Activity in
            Relation to Stress and Meditation” Citation: Ahmed M., Grillo M.,
            Taebi A., Kaya M., Gamage P.A. A Comprehensive Analysis of Trapezius
            Muscle EMG Activity in Relation to Stress and Meditation.
            BioMedInformatics. 2024;4(2):1047-1058. link MDPI Aim: To analyse
            how trapezius muscle EMG signal features differ between rest,
            stress, and meditation states using frequency-domain and asymmetry
            features. Key findings: Significant changes were found in EMG
            characteristics when comparing stress vs meditation vs rest. Both
            left and right trapezius muscle EMG can indicate these states; low
            frequency (LF) features were especially effective for distinguishing
            stress vs meditation. Implications: Excellent fit for your project
            because it shows that not just EMG amplitude but features within the
            EMG signal can differentiate mental states. You can reference this
            to justify using EMG and threshold logic in your app.

            2. Surface EMG and psychophysiological stress reactions in a
            real‐life situation” Citation: Rissén D., et al. Surface EMG and
            psychophysiological stress reactions in a real‐life study. (2000)
            PubMed; link PubMed Aim: To examine how sEMG activity (of the
            trapezius muscles) correlates with psychophysiological stress
            responses (heart rate, cortisol, self-reports) in female employees
            during actual work. Key findings: Significant correlations were
            found between higher self‐reported negative stress (feeling
            tense/exhausted) and increased sEMG activity. No correlation was
            found with positive feelings or with pain. The study supports that
            muscle tension (as measured by EMG) is linked to stress in real‐life
            work settings. Implications: Useful for your project as it shows EMG
            can reflect stress in everyday settings — supports your assumption
            that EMG values may indicate stress.

            3. Experimentally Induced Stress Validated by EMG Activity”
            Citation: Luijcks R., et al. Experimentally Induced Stress Validated
            by EMG Activity. (2014) PMC; link PMC Aim: To develop and validate a
            lab paradigm where uncontrollable/unpredictable stress is induced
            and validated via EMG activity and other measures. Key findings: EMG
            recordings from relevant muscles increased under stress induction;
            thus EMG is a valid indicator of induced psychological stress.
            Implications: Reinforces the premise that your EMG-based stress
            monitor is grounded in scientific research — EMG rises when stress
            is induced.
